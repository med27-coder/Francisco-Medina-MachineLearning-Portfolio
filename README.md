Welcome to my Machine Learning portfolio for ITAI 1371. The goal of this portfolio is to document my learning journey, demonstrate my understanding of the core ML concepts covered in class, and showcase the progress I’ve made.

About Me :

My name is Francisco Medina, and I am currently studying Artificial Intelligence. I am interested in machine learning because it allows us to uncover patterns in data and build systems that can learn, adapt, and improve over time. Through this course, I’ve gained hands-on experience with Python, working with datasets, building basic models, and evaluating their performance. This repository represents the practical work I completed as I developed these skills.

The purpose of this project is not to produce perfect code, but to create a portfolio that demonstrates:

-Show my understanding of machine learning concepts

-Present my skill in documenting my work clearly and thoughtfully to the current best of my abilities

-to present my overall growth throughout the course

This repository is intended to be something I can continue to build on — a foundation I can show instructors, classmates, and even future employers.
