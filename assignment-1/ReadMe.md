Having worked on Module 3 of the Machine Learning course was intriguing since it was 
a new experience for me. Before this, I had no idea what machine learning was at all. Having 
gone over the LO3  Exercise, seeing the actual workflow, training models, and understanding 
how different types of learning work gave me a better understanding of what is happening behind 
the scenes in machine learning. 

The big take away from the exercise that I got was understanding Supervised Learning, 
Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforced learning. From what I understand Supervised Learning 
focuses on giving the model data that is labeled and approved for it to process to find the wanted 
answer. While Unsupervised Learning focuses on giving the model unlabeled data so it can find 
patterns within the data that otherwise would not be noticeable. Reinforced Learning is what 
stood out to me because the model learns from trial and error, making it feel as though it was 
human. 

The part I did find challenging was the code itself. This comes from the fact that I have 
more hands-on experience. I can read and understand the code, but if I'm not able to code it 
myself, even if I'm just taking the long road of copying the code, it just doesn't fully click. To 
counter this, I'm thinking of doing what isaid, work on a different exercise and write the code 
down, gaining that sense of understanding the code better.  

What sparked my interest was how machine learning can be used in gaming. Such as 
reinforcement learning could be implemented by making NPC’s that adapt to how players 
behave, creating smarter and more dynamic gameplay. Thinking about AI in games made the 
topic feel more fun for me. To me I can envision worlds that evolve as players do to bring stories 
all on their own to immerse players even further into their worlds. Pushing the art of creativity to 
these worlds in the near future. 

Overall, the exercise gave me both a technical foundation and a creative idea. The 
challenging part was interpreting model results, but that also made it rewarding once I had a 
better grasp on it. I want to keep exploring how machine learning can be used responsibly, 
especially within the gaming industry. This reflection helped me realize that ML isn't just about 
coding, it's also about teaching systems to think and adapt, just like we do.
