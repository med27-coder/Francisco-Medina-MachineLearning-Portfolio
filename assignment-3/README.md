This project focused on building a sentiment analysis model to classify IMDB movie reviews as either positive or negative. The goal was to apply core machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, evaluate multiple models, and determine which approach offers the most reliable performance for analyzing audience feedback. The IMDB dataset originally contained 50,000 reviews, but for efficiency, a random sample of 5,000 reviews was used. The dataset was balanced, with nearly equal numbers of positive and negative reviews, which helped ensure fair model training and evaluation.

During exploratory data analysis, I examined the dataset’s structure, sentiment distribution, and text characteristics. The reviews averaged around 1,321 characters in length, with no significant length differences between positive and negative sentiments. Most reviews contained common stopwords and even HTML tags such as "<br />", emphasizing the need for thorough cleaning. No missing values were present, so preprocessing focused on text normalization: converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, URLs, numbers, mentions, hashtags, and extra whitespace. TF-IDF was used for feature extraction with 5,000 features, unigrams and bigrams, and stopwords removed. These steps helped reduce noise and capture meaningful patterns from the text. 

Three models were trained and evaluated: Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Random Forest. Logistic Regression performed best overall, achieving an accuracy of approximately 0.85 with strong precision, recall, and F1-score values. Naive Bayes produced nearly identical performance but trained significantly faster, making it a good option for large-scale or time-constrained scenarios. Random Forest underperformed compared to the simpler models, with lower accuracy and more misclassifications, suggesting that tree-based methods may not be as effective with sparse TF-IDF features. Confusion matrix analysis showed that errors often involved subtle or ambiguous review text, such as sarcasm or reviews combining mixed opinions, confirming the natural difficulty of sentiment detection. 

Overall, Logistic Regression is the most suitable model for deployment due to its consistent performance and interpretability, making it ideal for analyzing audience sentiment at scale. These results demonstrate how machine learning can transform raw text into meaningful insights for movie studios, streaming platforms, and marketing teams. With more time, expanding the dataset, adopting modern NLP embeddings, and experimenting with transformer-based models (like BERT) could further improve sentiment classification accuracy and better capture context, sarcasm, and nuanced opinions.
